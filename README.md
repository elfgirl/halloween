# Halloween Pi
Collection of Raspberry Pi driven Halloween props

## MotionSkull

Uses a [PIR Motion detector](https://www.adafruit.com/product/189) as an activator. The HIGH signal triggers a custom breakout board of three [2N3904](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/2N3904.pdf) transistors that drive three [12v LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PVVL2S6) (for that extra bright punch)

Currently, there are modes for solid eyes, flashing synchronously, and flashing L/R alternately.
